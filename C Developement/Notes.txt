    What is programming ?
        Computer programming is a medium for us to communicate with the computer. 

    What is C ?
        C is a programming language it is the oldest and the finest programming language
        It was developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T's Bell labs, USA in 1972.

    Uses of C
        1. Major parts of OS are written is C programming
        2. C is used to write driver programs for devices like Tablet , printers etc.
        3. C language is used to embedded system where  program need to run faster in limited memory.



Chapter 1

    Our First program

        #include <stdio.h>
        int main() {
            printf("Hello World");
            return 0;
        } 

    Variables
        A variable is a container which stores a value and it's value can change
        For E.g : 
        a = 3  // a is assigned "3"
        b = 4.7 // b is assigned "4.7"
        c = "A" // c is assigned "A"
    Rules for naming variable
        1. First Chararcter must be an Alphabet or an underscore(_) and dollar ($)
        2. No commas , white space allowed
        3. No Splecial symbol allowed except underscore (_) and dollar ($)
        4. Variable names are case sensitive means that "A" and "a" are diffrent 
        5. You can use any number any symbol between the variable names

    Constants
        A constant value can't be changed

    Types of Constants
        -> Integer constant E.g : -1 ,5 , 7 , 10 
        An integer constant is a number that represents an integral value . 
        It can't contain decimal values & fractional values.
        -> Real constant E.g : 3.22 , 1.0 
        Real constants that contain a decimal point or a fraction value. 
        The real constants are also called as floating point constants. 
        The real constant contains a decimal point and a fractional value.
        -> Chararcter constant -> '@', '#', '$','%' 
        A "character constant" is formed by enclosing a single character from the representable character set within single quotation marks (' ').
        Character constants are used to represent characters in the execution character set

    Keywords
        These are reserved words, whose meaning is already known to the compiler. 
        There are 32 keywords available in c:
        --------------------------------------------
        | auto      | double   | int    | struct   |
        | break     | long     | else   | switch   |
        | case      | return   | enum   | typedef  |
        | character | register | extern | union    |
        | const     | short    | float  | unsigned |
        | continue  | signed   | for    | void     |
        | default   | sizeof   | goto   | volatile |
        | do        | static   | if     | while    |
        --------------------------------------------


    The basic structure of a C program
        All c programs have to follow a basic structure. A c program starts with the main function and executes instructions presents inside it. Each instruction terminated with a semicolon(;)

        There are some basic rules which are applicable to all the c programs:

       1. Every program's execution starts from the main function.
       2. All the statements are terminated with a semi-colon.
       3. Instructions are case sensitive.
       4. Instructions are executed in the same order in which they are written.
    
    Comments
        Comments are used to clarify something about the program in plain language. 
        It is a way for us to add notes to our program. There are two types of comments in c:
        Single line comment: //This is a comment.
        Multi line comment : /* This is multi line comment */
        Multi line comment : /**/
        Signle line comment : //
        Comments in a C program are not executed and ignored.

        * Shortcut for commenting
        For Mac
         cmd(command) + /
        For Windows and Linux
         ctrl(control) + /
